## Introduction

This is like first time writing my thought in this length in English. 


I am a developer with nine years of experience! 26 years old! I started my career right after graduating from high school. During that year, I tried hustling many, many times. But I always got tired and quit after one or two months.

Back then, I thought my will was not strong enough, and I was too lazy to achieve my dream. Every time I failed, I felt terrible for myself and got depressed. 

Depression threw me into a destructive cycle. I was hunting for quick and effortless dopamine. Scrolling endless YouTube shorts over and over again.

One day, just as usual, I scrolled over YouTube shorts. And found advertisement about self help. It was from influencer Jachung, a famous Korean influencer. He said the reason people fail to do what they want is because they do not write. 


I thought it was BS. Right? Writing.. Huh.. But one thing kept listening to his message. I remembered him. He was famous like 1~2 years ago. And got even more famous now. 

So.. maybe.. he is right. Perhaps writing really helped him get his work done.

So, I purchased the lecture about writing. I have never been serious about writing before, IT WAS HARD. I felt like my brain was melting down. 

But I kept going because there was a prize for those who finished the mission and lecture in 30 days. The prize was an offline lecture.

And that prize motivated me a lot and helped me get used to writing. And writing helped me A LOT. When I write, my anxiety starts to fade away. And I figured out what I should do next. So, I started doing more, less worrying.

I found many people with the help of writing(in Korean). A people who know why writing matters and get things done. I have been working on my SaaS project for more than three months. (THIS is a world record for me, LOL)

Well. This is a story of me getting started.

Now that I kinda got used to writing in Korean, I decided to get used to writing in English. It's hard as F but i will help me achieve my life's goal. 

Save time for people who have dreams. And help them make world a better place.

I don't know I will be able to acehive that. But there is one thing I know. I will bring my dream into this world. I just don't have to give up.
